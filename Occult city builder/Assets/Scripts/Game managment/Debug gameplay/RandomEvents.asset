  madnesEvents:
  - ' Sanity is not a default state of mind nor is it a right. Sanity is a gift,
    we have been robbed of. Cleanse the village of the unpure or risk to join them,
    my Lord!  '
  - 'The mask of sanity was removed, and people smile their true smiles... Give them
    a reason to weep, my Lord !!! '
  - ' When whispers of the wind start making sense, you know it is time to silence
    the people, my Lord... '
  desiseEvents:
  - 'Bodies left to decompose on the streets have tendency to grow in numbers. Pay
    gold... or let death feast, my Lord. '
  - 'Doctors want gold, commoners want to live... The choise is yours, my Lord. '

    to pay in gold than in your life. '
  wildAnimalsEvents:
  - Ancient unspeakable terror is not the only thing devouring our livestock, there
    are also wolfs. Build walls, my Lord... or don't.
  - Even wild beasts are bound to the shadowy will... At least from this, we can
    hide behind the walls. If you are willing to spend some wood, that is, my Lord...
  - 'Fangs and claws can be warded off by spears and palisades. It is wood or blood...
    Choose wisely, my Lord. '
  starvationEvents:
  - Shadows aren't the only things that can starve, people can also. Feed them, my
    Lord.
  - Livestock to people as people to shadows. You do understand the hint, my Lord?!
  - Starving people aren't much of a sacrifice. It likes them plump, my Lord...
  fallingStarEvents:
  - The priests are fascinated by a passing comet... And you thought they are the
    smart ones, my Lord
  - When Stars are falling from the sky, it isn't a time for logic, my Lord
  - Make a wish, my Lord
